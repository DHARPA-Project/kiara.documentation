# kiara

*kiara* is a data orchestration engine developed by the [DHARPA project](https://dharpa.org). It uses a modular approach
to let users re-use tried and tested data orchestration pipelines, as well as create new ones from existing building
blocks. It also helps you manage your research data, and augment it with automatically-, semi-automatically-, and manually-
created metadata. Most of this is not yet implemented.
